<h1><strong>Module 01: Introduction to Family Law</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Introduction to the Module</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Family law is a branch of law that specialises on problems affecting family ties, including marriage, adoption, divorce, and child custody, among others. In family court hearings or other relevant agreements, family law attorneys may represent clients. They may also create crucial legal papers like property agreements or court petitions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some family law specialists also focus on issues unrelated to divorce, such as emancipation, paternity, and adoption. The topic of family touches on so many facets of life. As a result, attorneys in the sector assist clients with a wide range of delicate concerns that many people wouldn't presume fall within the purview of family law.</span></p>

<p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><strong>Concept of Family</strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The family is a close-knit domestic unit made up of individuals who are linked to one another by blood connections, sexual relationships, or legal ties. The most significant main group present in every civilization, it is also the smallest and most fundamental social unit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's society's basic group. It's a father, mother, and one or more children. A child's first social group. It's the most persistent group, influencing people from birth to death. It's also the longest-lasting social relationship. Different sociologists define family.</span></p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of Family:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Marriage involves two adults of opposing sex mating.</span></li>

<p><strong>Functions of Family:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a social group and social institution, family serves numerous functions:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Families procreate. Marriage regulates sexuality and forms a family, which is strengthened through children.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Families regulate and control reproduction. Families justify reproduction.</span></li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What Is Family Law?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal matters regarding family ties, such as divorce and child custody, are within the practise area of family law. Typically, the family law cases that our lawyers handle include divorce, child custody, child support, and other relevant legal issues.</span></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Trial VS. Mediation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mediation: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A voluntary method of settling family problems when a qualified mediator aids parties in equal negotiating positions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawyers, psychologists, and other professionals are mediators. As family mediators, they assist parties establish agreements on support payments, property distribution, child custody, and other family-related matters. Mediators don't take sides or make decisions. No legal advice is given.</span></p>
<p><strong>Trial: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">There can be occasions when divorcing couples can't agree on money, property, or child care. In such circumstances, you'll need a judge's help. You may petition the court to intervene if your spouse is treating family assets, financial support, or parenting concerns unjustly or improperly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br /><br /><br /><strong><strong>The Changing Face of Family Law</strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Family law has traditionally been adult-centric and hasn't focused on the kid, causing friction between parents and affecting the youngster's mental health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resolution was founded in the early 1980s to reform the way family law operates, providing clients more peaceful solutions and giving children a more optimistic view. Resolution focuses on specialised training and multidisciplinary work for family attorneys, producing many client-focused lawyers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resolution supports the "no fault divorce campaign" in hopes that it would reduce stress and conflict during a separation, benefiting the children. Resolution's no fault divorce campaign will be enacted by 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully, the Positive Parenting Alliance campaign and Resolutions' work to develop criteria for peaceful, child-focused attorneys will reduce the number of children harmed by separation dispute.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><strong>How Family Law Differs from Civil Litigation?</strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Family Law addresses a number of laws that govern families' legal status and relationships. Family law involves divorce and legal separation, child custody and visitation, child support, temporary spousal support, and long-term spousal support. Family law encompasses unmarried parentage situations and cohabiting partners with a contract (see Marvin v. Marvin). Adoptions and child dependence are another part of family law (usually involving Child Protective Services). Family law disputes might contain domestic abuse allegations between spouses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Civil law includes human injuries, contract breaches, civil fraud, commercial litigation, civil tort claims, and property disputes. These aren't family law cases. Sacramento's civil and family law courts are separate. Civil judges can't hear family law matters; only the family court may.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><strong>The Function of Family Law</strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are four separates but connected functions in family law. In order to support social institutions like marriage and parenthood, family law's primary objective is to promote them. The 4 main purposes of family law are as follows.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Definition And Alteration of Status</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, this was the law's principal function since it covered family rights and property. In the event of a man and woman living together, they only arise if they're married, and their legal connection relies heavily on their status. Children had little rights and obligations unless they were genuine.</span></p>
<p><strong>Resolution of disputes</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a family unit breaks apart, the courts may arbitrate issues between family members. Residence, upbringing, and interaction with children, and right to occupy marriage house are major sources of conflict.</span></p>
<p><strong>Protection</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical and economic support of weaker family members. Courts may protect victims of domestic violence (wives, husbands, cohabitants, or children) by issuing non-molestation orders and barring a party from the marital home. As a final option, they may order a kid into local care. The economic protection of a family member becomes important when the family unit dissolves, either via separation or death. The courts have broad powers to impose orders for financial assistance in both cases.</span></p>
<p><strong>Property adjustment and division</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if family dissolution leaves people well-off. On the breakup of a marriage and, to a lesser degree, on the death of a family member, justice may mandate the redistribution of their capital assets. If a person dies intestate, his property must be dispersed. The law of intestate succession is part of family law since it divides a dead person's property among his family members. In the last century, English family law has shifted from the first to the other three duties, and now its remedial role is more important than giving rights. Parliament and appellate courts may spell out fundamental guidelines for resolving child disputes or awarding financial relief, but individual judges have far more freedom. Their use varies greatly per family.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br /><br /><br /><strong><strong>Family Law and Human Rights</strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Family law and human rights are intertwined. Being part of a family is vital to being a person, and human rights might clash in family problems. If the court becomes involved, the decision-maker must balance the human rights of the family members involved, who are often confronted with opposing concerns.</span></p>
<p><strong>Human rights in UK law</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Human Rights Act 1998 brought the ECHR into UK legislation on 2 October 2000. This implies that ECHR rights and freedoms (e.g., right to life, fair trial, freedom of speech) may be enforced in British courts. Most UK human rights cases may now be decided here instead of in Strasbourg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Human Rights Act acts in three primary ways:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By ensuring courts interpret laws in line with ECHR. Parliamentary sovereignty will take priority over ECHR principles owing to clause 3(2)(b) of the Human Rights Act, which provides that legislation passed by parliament but contradictory to the ECHR must remain legal and effective. The courts may consider amending the law to avoid ECHR violations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By requiring public officials to follow the ECHR. The court is a public authority, so parties to legal processes - including divorce or child custody - who believe they've been treated unfairly may raise the matter in court rather than making a separate application. If there are no court proceedings - for example, if a local authority or other public body's decision is challenged on human rights grounds - the person claiming a breach can start court proceedings in the UK (rather than the European Court of Human Rights) to seek a remedy for their human rights breach.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When main legislation can't be implemented in a fashion that conforms with the human rights convention, the courts may issue a "declaration of incompatibility," allowing the government to alter the law quickly. When a legislation cannot (or will not) be altered, the case might be referred to the European Court of Human Rights.</span></li>
</ul>
